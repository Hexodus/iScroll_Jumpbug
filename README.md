iScroll 4 Jumpbug Demonstration
===============================
This demo shows a bug that occures using JQM 1.2 and iScroll 4 with iScrollview on Android 2.x Devices. 
When you drag the page a little down and then use the second swipe trigger, the page jumps to the bottom 
over the border and "stucks" there - it's not more possible to scroll to the top. Looks a like the scrollable area redefines itself.
